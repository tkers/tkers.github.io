# Hi, I'm Tijn!

{% include portrait.html img="assets/img/lx42.jpg" %}

I am a software developer from Amsterdam. Mostly writing (some flavour of) JavaScript, interested in anything functional or reactive, and rarely seen without a cup of coffee. After office hours I like to tinker around with esoteric compilers or hack on old Game Boy hardware.

You can find me online on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tijnosaurus), [GitHub](https://github.com/tkers) and [itch.io](https://tkers.itch.io).
